## Kubernetes Concepts and Example Commands

Here's a breakdown of the concepts discussed in the transcript, along with example commands to illustrate them:

### 1. Containerization with Docker

**Concept:** The transcript emphasizes the importance of understanding Docker before diving into Kubernetes. Docker allows you to package applications into containers, making them portable and consistent across different environments.

**Example Commands:**

*   **Build a Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-app:latest .
    ```
*   **Run a Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-app:latest
    ```
*   **View running containers:**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
*   **Stop a container:**
    ```bash
    docker stop <container_id>
    ```
*   **Remove a container:**
    ```bash
    docker rm <container_id>
    ```

### 2. Kubernetes as a Container Orchestration Platform

**Concept:** Kubernetes is introduced as a container orchestration platform that addresses the limitations of Docker in managing containers at scale. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### 3. Addressing Docker Limitations with Kubernetes

The transcript outlines three main limitations of Docker that Kubernetes addresses:

#### 3.1 Single Host Limitation

**Problem:** Docker containers running on a single host can be affected by resource constraints, leading to instability.

**Kubernetes Solution:** Kubernetes allows you to distribute containers across multiple nodes (servers) in a cluster, providing better resource utilization and high availability.

#### 3.2 Auto-Healing

**Problem:** Docker doesn't automatically restart failed containers.

**Kubernetes Solution:** Kubernetes provides self-healing capabilities. It automatically restarts containers that fail, ensuring that your application remains available.

**Example Commands:**

*   **Deploying an application in Kubernetes:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```
    *(where `deployment.yaml` defines the desired state of your application, including the number of replicas and restart policy)*

*   **Checking the status of deployments:**
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployments
    ```

#### 3.3 Auto-Scaling

**Problem:** Docker doesn't automatically scale the number of containers based on traffic.

**Kubernetes Solution:** Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of containers based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics. This ensures that your application can handle varying levels of traffic.

**Example Commands:**

*   **Scaling a deployment:**
    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3
    ```

*   **Setting up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
    ```bash
    kubectl autoscale deployment my-app --cpu-percent=80 --min=1 --max=10
    ```
    *(This command creates an HPA that scales the `my-app` deployment between 1 and 10 replicas based on CPU utilization)*

### 4. Load Balancing

**Concept:** Kubernetes uses load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple containers, ensuring high availability and performance.

**Example Commands:**

*   **Creating a service to expose a deployment:**
    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment my-app --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type=LoadBalancer
    ```
    *(This command creates a LoadBalancer service that distributes traffic to the `my-app` deployment)*

*   **Getting information about services:**
    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```

**Important Notes:**

*   These are basic examples, and the specific commands and configurations will vary depending on your application and environment.
*   Kubernetes uses YAML files to define deployments, services, and other resources. You'll need to create these files based on your application's requirements.
*   It's highly recommended to go through official Kubernetes tutorials and documentation to gain a deeper understanding of the platform.
